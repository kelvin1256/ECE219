# ECE219 Large Scale Data Minning Models & Algorithms 

Project I : End To End Pipeline to Classify News Articles 
Project II: Data Representation & Clustering 

Scope
The main objective for Project I is to build an end-to-end pipeline to classify samples of new articles.Below are the Machine Learning applications that were implemented to analyze the end-to-end pipeline. 

1: Feature Extraction
2: Dimension Reduction
3: Application of Simple Classification Models 
4: Pipeline Evaluation 
5: Replace Corpus-level features with pertained features


All Questions are compiled into one notebook 

Note: There are some duplicate imports for question Q1-Q13, but was kept due to issues arising when they are erased. 

Run each line in colab in order and Notebook should function as intended.  
Below are the question answered in our notebook

Q1-Q7 : Includes splitting the dataset, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms.
Q8(Grid_Search_Uncleaned). : Builds and performs the grid search pipeline for uncleaned data.
Q8(Grid_Search_Cleaned) : Builds and performs the grid search pipeline for cleaned data.
Q9(Multiclass) : Includes multiclass classification of the given dataset.
Q10-Q13(GLoVE) : Includes GLoVE embeddings.
